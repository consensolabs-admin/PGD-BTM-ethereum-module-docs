* Equity
* Identity

## Decentralized exchange \(DEX\) 

DEX helps to exchange one digital asset with the other without a central authority to process the transaction.

### Examples

* [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/)

## Decentralized finance \(DeFi\) protocols

DeFi is a movement to transform the traditional finance products and protocols into a completely decentralized way without any intermediaries. Some of the decentralized products are stable coins, lending protocols, predication markets. Checkout the full list [here](https://wiki.defi.org/Main_Page).

### Examples

* [Compound finance](https://compound.finance/) - Lending protocol
* [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/) - Stable coin protocol
* [InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io/) - DeFi tool

### MakerDAO's DAI

**DAI** is a decentralized stable coin whose value is pegged to the USD and backed by cryptocurrency.

DAI uses system called to **Collateralized dept position** \(CDP\) to back and stabilize the value of DAI. During the creation of CDP,  the user will provide  ETH as collateral to mint DAI tokens which will act as dept instrument. User needs to always over collateralize \(at least 150 %\) to guarantee the debt position. In case the ETH value goes drastically down and the collateral to debt ration falls below 150 %, then the collateral will be liquidated automatically paying back the excess collateral to the owner.

## Decentralized Identity \(uPort, Civic\)

## Ethereum naming service \(ENS\)

ENS is a decentralized and public naming service on Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates to easily identify the user address with human readable names similar to website domain names. It also allows to create sub domains just like centralized DNS. Registering a domain will cost $ 5 / year.

Ethereum addresses can be registered at the official [ENS Manager](https://manager.ens.domains) or other wallets such as [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/access-my-wallet).
