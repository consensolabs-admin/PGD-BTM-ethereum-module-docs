# Setup and quick start

Although the guide uses Linux based system \(Ubuntu 16.04\) for the demonstration, all the tools, applications and scripts used can be executed on Windows or Mac systems.

### Required packages and tools

#### Node.js and npm

Node.js can be downloaded and installed from the official [site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once Node.js is installed, npm will also be installed alongside and will be available as an executable.

Linux based systems can install the Node through package manager tool such as APT. Here is an install guide for [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04).
