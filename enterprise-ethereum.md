# Enterprise Ethereum

Enterprise Ethereum is a private, consortium based implementation of the Ethereum code base to solve the numerous business use cases where the traditional technology has proved to be inefficient,

Business, government, financial institutions are exploring the application of the Ethereum based distributed ledger to reduce inefficiencies, cost of trust and create the new business model with the help [consensys](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/) organization to build, test and deploy the solutions. 

## [Enterprise Ethereum use cases](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/use-cases/)

Several major sectors have already implemented the enterprise Ethereum solution.

* **Banking and Finance**
* **International Trade and Commodities**
* **Supply Chain**
* **Energy**
* **Identity**

#### Few of the promising case studies

* [Project i2i](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/use-cases/banking-and-finance/project-i2i/) - Blockchain Payments in the Philippines
* [Project Khokha](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/use-cases/banking-and-finance/project-khokha/) -  Blockchain for central banking in South Africa

## Ethereum platforms for business

* [Hyperledger Besu](https://pegasys.tech/enterprise/) by Pegasys
* [Kaleido](https://kaleido.io/)

## [Enterprise Ethereum standards](https://entethalliance.org/)

Just like any other technology protocol, DLT also requires a set of standards to ensure interoperability  between the businesses worldwide. Enterprise Ethereum member-driven standards association called Enterprise Ethereum Alliance \(EEA\) to develop blockchain specifications to be used in each pf the enterprise platforms.
