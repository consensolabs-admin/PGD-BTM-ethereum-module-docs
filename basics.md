# Ethereum Basics

## Ether currency

Ether \(ETH or Îž\) is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. It could be used as:

* Store of value \(e.g. in lending collateral\)
* A medium of exchange \(e.g. in trade and payments\)

## Types of accounts

## Wallets

In its basic sense, wallet is something manages keys and addresses , tracks and transacts user's money.

But most of the Ethereum wallets are capable fully interacting with smart contracts and Ethereum nodes.

* Ledger Nano S \(Hardware wallet\)
* MetaMask \(Web wallet + DApp Bridge \)
* [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) \(Web + Mobile wallet\)
* TrustWallet \(Mobile wallet\)

## Transactions

These are signed messages originated by externally owned account and transmitted to the Ethereum network  and finally recorded on the blockchain.
