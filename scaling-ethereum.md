# Scaling Ethereum

Just like Bitcoin or any other public blockchain, Ethereum also suffers from limited scalability of the transactions. Ethereum mainly suffers due to two reasons:

1.  Proof-of-work consensus algorithm which has higher finality \(settlement \) time.
2. High GAS cost for each smart contract interaction.

There are two layer 2 solutions to solve the scalability issue of Ethereum network - **State channels** and **Side chains**.

## State channels 

### Raiden Network

## Sidechains 

### Matic network:

### Loom network:

## Ethereum 2.0
