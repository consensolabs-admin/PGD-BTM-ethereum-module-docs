# What is Ethereum?

> Ethereum - "the world computer". It is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine with a globally accessible singleton state and virtual machine that applies state changes.

Just like Bitcoin Ethereum is a decentralized infrastructure but executes and maintains contracts in blockchain.  

## Bitcoin comparison

Although Ethereum is highly influenced by Bitcoin, they have some major differences.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Similarities

* Peer-to-peer networking, block exchange mechanisms
* Proof-of-work consensus algorithm
* Digital assets
* Use of cryptographic primitives \(Digital signatures, hash functions\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Differences

* Ethereum can act as a general purpose computer with smart contracts and virtual machine \(EVM\) - Turing complete
* Ethereum is not just a payment network
* Ethereum doesn't use UTXO model to keep track of payments. Instead maintains the account information in state.

## History

As Bitcoin's popularity grew people saw the potential of decentralization beyond money. Building upon Bitcoin proved difficult due its self imposed limitations.
